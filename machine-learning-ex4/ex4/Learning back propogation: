Learning back propogation:


Continuing  with Andrew Ng's course is certainly fun. But I cannot live with not knowing something. Especially if that something is coming from my niche. Calculus isnt that tough. So, isnt series mathemetics. Than how can we not know how to work with it?

So starts our long journey of deciphering the black box.

	3blue1brown's videos
	Myraid of blogs trying to explain what goes behind.
	Mark neilson's book on neural nets
	Ryan harris's derivation videos

What helped the most?
	Finally sitting with a pen and paper and derving it myself.



Ryan harris's videos helped.
I think more than that, just spending more time with this helped.
